Beachball Example Image Sequence
################################

The example images in this folder are singlepart and multipart
versions of the same multichannel image sequence. The multipart
version is compatible only with OpenEXR-2.0 and later. These are
intended to exercise many features of the (regular scanline) InputPart
interface to the library and are recommended test cases for code which
reads them. Code should either read them all correctly, read some
parts of the file correctly, or else at the least report errors
gracefully.

When viewed in a stereo viewing environment, the images form a
sequence of a ball moving towards screen right. The ball should appear
to float in front of the screen, not behind it.

Note: *the content of channels other than RGBAZ in these examples is
arbitrary, and should not be considered a standard approach for
representing and naming conventions for data such as motion vectors,
stereo disparity or grading masks. They have simply been included here
as a realistic example of non-RGBA data.*

Note the following about these images:

* These images are stereo, multiview images, containing data for both
  left and right eyes.
  
  The single part file has a ``multiView`` attribute, the first part of
  the multipart file has a ``view`` attribute.

* The right eye is the **default** or **hero** eye in this case

  The first part in the multipart image has view attribute set to
  right; the single part image lists ``"right"`` as the first view in
  the ``multiView`` attribute.

* **View names are present** in the channel names of the **single part** file,
  except for the right view's RGBAZ views, which have no view names

* View names are not present in the multipart file channel names

* The **first part** of the multipart exr contains the **default channels** of
  the **default view**
  
  Software recompiled against EXR-2.0 which doesn't use the multipart
  API will only load the default channels of the default view

* **Layer names are present** in both the single and multipart file â€“ they
  are not dropped, nor is the part name used to derive layer names.

* **No part in a multipart file can contain channels for multiple
  views**

  In a file with more than one part, the view attribute is used to
  identify the view for all channels in that part, and all channels
  belong to the specified view

* **Parts have consistent ``displayWindow`` attributes**

* **Parts do not have consistent dataWindow attributes**
  
  *The ability to specify different dataWindows for different channels,
  by dividing them into different parts, is one of the motivating
  factors for the EXR-2.0 multipart extension.*
  
  Code reading from different parts must be sure not to read from
  scanlines which are not present in the part's ``dataWindow``, as that
  will result in an exception.

  Reading a channel with a ``dataWindow`` smaller than the memory
  allocated could result in uninitialised memory.

  The first part's ``dataWindow`` is not guaranteed to enclose the
  dataWindow of other parts

* In frames 7 and 8, the **``dataWindow`` extends outside the ``displayWindow``**

* **Division of channels within one view between parts is arbitrary**

  In this case, generally each part contains a separate layer, though
  the RGBAZ layer has been split into across one part for RGBA and another for Z

  The decision of how to "package" channels into different parts is
  generally driven by read performance and filesize requirements. If
  only RGBA channels are commonly read, it would be best to store only
  those channels in a part, as in this case. For realtime playback of
  just RGB, it may be advantageous to store A separately to RGB. Many
  rarely read data channels which have similar data content and
  dataWindows would compress better if stored in the same part. Notice
  the scheme used here leads to files which are approx 20% larger than
  storing all channels in one part.

* The ``disparityR`` and ``disparityL`` channels are **not associated
  with a view**

  There is no view name in the channel names in the single part file,
  even though it has a layer name, indicating it is not view
  associated. The disparity parts in the multipart file do not have a
  view attribute.

  *Arguably, disparity data is associated with the source view - it is
  included here merely to illustrate that channels needn't be
  associated with a view.*

* The **depth** channel is called ``"Z"`` in all cases, in keeping wih
  the convention for deep images

  The convention is optional for regular scanline and tile images, but
  is is practical to maintain it for all image types.

  This means that depth is part of the RGBAZ layer in EXR
  parlance. Many software packages internally associate depth
  differently to RGBA.
